Functions:

Generate_environments:
Main sample generator. Controls generate_in_file to generate multiple environment to specs based on arguments.

varargin - materials

Generate_in_file:
Generates randomized .in file for training/testing. Most complicated, needs to be hard rewritten with functions rather than script style. Needs pass arguments from generate_environment.

Stuff to change in generate_environment:
change antenna separation from 0.14 to 0.04 as per manufacturer spec in .rad file
change source and receiver locations to suit
    x_offset = 0.1 +- antenna_seperation/2
    Tx 0.030 Rx 0.170
    Tx 0.080 Rx 0.120
change rebar permittivity value and also just don't use it lolz. Use PEC identifier instead


Generate dataset:
main processing file
generates testing and training dataset by combining gprMax output and permittivity map image

Generate permittivity map:
generates permittivity map based on .in file passed as argument and stores it in
./permittivity_map_images/ 
default to logit scaling for permittivity scaling

importfile:
needed by generate_dataset to read .txt file formatted to spec

mala_source/mala_source_modified:
file used in gprMax to act as custom waveform




File structure:
./permittivity_map_images/
contains the ground truth permittivity map images

./in_files/
contains the simulation in files ready to run on gprMax

./gprMax_output/
contains either raw _merged.out or .txt files from gprMax output with respect to ./in_files
Note that raw files are ~3x larger than .txt files... easier to keep maintain .txt

available materials:
- concrete: box
- pec: cylinder
- air: box
